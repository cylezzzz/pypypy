# How to include the router

In `server/app.py`, after your other routers are included, add:

```python
try:
    from server.api.generation_endpoints import router as gen_router
    app.include_router(gen_router)
    logger.info("âœ… Generation endpoints eingebunden")
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Generation endpoints nicht geladen: {e}")
```
